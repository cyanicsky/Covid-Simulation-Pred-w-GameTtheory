# Covid-Simulation-Pred-w-GameTheory

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementing a deep learning workflow for analyzing and modeling data with a focus on small population datasets.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following sections:

1. **Importing Libraries**: Includes necessary dependencies such as `numpy`, `pandas`, and deep learning libraries.
2. **Data Processing**: Functions for loading and preprocessing data from CSV files.
3. **Deep Learning Model**: A model tailored for scenarios with limited data, addressing specific challenges of small population datasets.
4. **Scenarios and Analysis**: Simulated cases to demonstrate the model's capabilities and performance.

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `tensorflow` or `keras`
- `matplotlib`

You can install these dependencies via pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas tensorflow matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
